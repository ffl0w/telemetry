# ðŸ“ž telemetry
Approaching declarative programming with reactions on the go.

----

## The problem

Declarative programming is a great way for developers to write brief statements to a machine in how they want
data to be structured without actually computing it themselves. It allows for quick processing without the developer
needing to stand by the machine's side to help it interpret what they want done. There's one major issue with it
though: maintaining it slowly becomes hell due to the strictness and minimal allowance for the machine to conform
structuring.

## The solution

In contrast to imperative programming with procedurally handling data structures with typing, aliases and pointers,
telemetry takes a new approach by basing structures off of a common internal "ruleset." This ruleset works off of
an object-oriented set of instructions which are predetermined programmatically and given to the developer to abide by,
much like a set of "laws of the land."

## Development

telemetry is being actively developed upon, with no set release date for v1.0.

### Tools/Workflows

telemetry uses some of the most common used practices in the software industry, as well as the following tools:

- [Conventional Commits 1.0.0-beta.1](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.1/#specification)
- [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
- [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystorm](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

### Activity

This project is something I work on in my spare time when I am not working my job, not working on my
[main project](https://github.com/interactions-py/library), not busy with personal life events or anything
else barring me access from being able to sit down at my computer and do something after relaxing. Because of this,
activity and development may and will likely fluctuate between time periods.
